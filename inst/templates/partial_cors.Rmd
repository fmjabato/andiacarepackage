## **Main correlations**

Main columns are studied now in order to check correlation between them into this cohort:

```{r corr_matrix, echo = FALSE}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(andiacare::corrChart(cohort),
    top = grid::textGrob("Cohort correlations",
        gp = gpar(fontsize = 20, font = 3)))
```
